# Fisheries of the world

Fisheries and Aquaculture Department of the Food and Agriculture Organization of 
the United Nations collects data on fisheries production of countries. The (not-so-great) visualization below shows the distribution of fishery harvest 
of countries for 2016, by capture and aquaculture.  

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/fisheries-data.png")
```

- Countries whose total harvest was less than 100,000 tons are not 
included in the visualization.
- Source: [Fishing industry by country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_industry_by_country)
]

```
Question: What are some ways you would improve the following visualization?
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/fisheries.png")
```

- Calculate summary statistics at the continent level and visualize them.
- Map the data.


## The data

Let's load the data:

```{r}
fisheries <- read_csv("data/fisheries.csv")
names(fisheries)
```

And inspect it:

```{r}
fisheries
```

## Data prep

Filter out countries whose total harvest was less than 100,000 tons since they 
are not included in the visualization:

```{r}
fisheries <- fisheries %>%
  filter(total > 100000)
fisheries
```

Then, we will join this with the continent data.

```{r}
continents <- read_csv("data/continents.csv")
continents
```

# Data joins

## Joining data frames

```
something_join(x, y)
```

- `inner_join()`: all rows from x where there are matching values in y, return 
all combination of multiple matches in the case of multiple matches
- `left_join()`: all rows from x
- `right_join()`: all rows from y
- `full_join()`: all rows from both x and y
- `anti_join()`: return all rows from x where there are not matching values in y, never duplicate rows of x
- ...

For the next bit...

```{r echo=FALSE}
x <- tibble(value = c(1, 2, 3))
```
```{r}
x
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
y <- tibble(value = c(1, 2, 4))
```
```{r}
y
```

### `inner_join()`

```{r}
inner_join(x, y)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/inner-join.gif")
```

### `left_join()`

```{r}
left_join(x, y)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/left-join.gif")
```

### `right_join()`

```{r}
right_join(x, y)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/right-join.gif")
```

### `full_join()`

```{r}
full_join(x, y)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/full-join.gif")
```

### `anti_join()`

```{r}
anti_join(x, y)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/anti-join.gif")
```

```
Question: We want to keep all rows and columns from `fisheries` and add a 
column for corresponding continents. Which join function should we use?
```

```{r}
fisheries %>% select(country)
```

```{r}
continents
```

## Join fisheries and continents 

```{r}
fisheries <- left_join(fisheries, continents) 
```

```
Question: How does `left_join()` know to join the two data frames by `country`?
```

Hint:

- Variables in the original fisheries dataset:

```{r echo=FALSE}
fisheries %>% select(-continent) %>% names()
```

- Variables in the continents dataset:

```{r echo=FALSE}
names(continents)
```

Let's check to make sure all countries now have a continent assigned.

```{r}
fisheries %>%
  filter(is.na(continent))
```

Nope!

We will need to manually fix some of these.

```{r}
fisheries <- fisheries %>%
  mutate(continent = case_when(
    country == "Democratic Republic of the Congo" ~ "Africa",
    country == "Hong Kong"                        ~ "Asia",
    country == "Myanmar"                          ~ "Asia",
    TRUE                                          ~ continent
    )
  )
```

...and check again

```{r}
fisheries %>%
  filter(is.na(continent))
```

```
Question: What does the following code do?
```

```{r}
fisheries <- fisheries %>%
  mutate(aquaculture_perc = aquaculture / total)
```

## Continent-level statistics

```{r}
fisheries_summary <- fisheries %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarise(
    min_ap  = min(aquaculture_perc),
    mean_ap = mean(aquaculture_perc),
    max_ap  = max(aquaculture_perc)
  ) 

fisheries_summary
```

## Visualize continent summary stats

```{r fig.height=3,fig.width=7}
ggplot(fisheries_summary, aes(x = continent, y = mean_ap)) +
  geom_col()
```

## Improve visualization

```{r}
ggplot(fisheries_summary, 
       aes(y = fct_reorder(continent, mean_ap), x = mean_ap)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = percent) + #<<
  labs(
    x = "", y = "",
    title = "Average share of aquaculture by continent",
    subtitle = "out of total fisheries harvest, 2016",
    caption = "Source: bit.ly/2VrawTt"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

# Mapping

## Mapping the fisheries data

- Obtain country boundaries and store as a data frame
- Join the fisheries and country boundaries data frames
- Plot the country boundaries, and fill by fisheries harvest data

The `map_data()` function easily turns data from the maps package in to a data frame suitable for plotting with ggplot2:

```{r}
head(map_data("world"))
```

## A few fixes for better matching

```
Question: What does the following code do?
```

```{r}
world_map <- map_data("world") %>%
  mutate(region = case_when(
    region == "UK"           ~ "United Kingdom",
    region == "USA"          ~ "United States",
    subregion == "Hong Kong" ~ "Hong Kong",
    TRUE                     ~ region
    )
  )
```

## Map the world

```{r}
ggplot(world_map, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(fill = "gray") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Join fisheries and world map

```{r}
fisheries_map <- left_join(fisheries, world_map, 
                           by = c("country" = "region"))
```

```{r}
glimpse(fisheries_map)
```

## Mapping fisheries

```{r}
ggplot(fisheries_map, mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(fill = capture)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  theme_minimal()
```

```
Question: What is misleading about the map above?
```

## Putting it altogether

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(world_map, 
               mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), 
               fill = "lightgray") +
  geom_polygon(fisheries_map, 
               mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, 
                             fill = capture)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  labs(
    x = "", y = "",
    title = "Fisheries harvest by capture, 2016",
    subtitle = "Capture measured in tonnes",
    caption = "Source: bit.ly/2VrawTt"
  )
```

## Log scale

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(world_map, mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), fill = "lightgray") +
  geom_polygon(fisheries_map, mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = log(capture))) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  labs(
    x = "", y = "",
    title = "Fisheries harvest by capture, 2016",
    subtitle = "Capture measured in logged tonnes",
    caption = "Source: bit.ly/2VrawTt"
  )
```

## Aquaculture

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(world_map, mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), fill = "lightgray") +
  geom_polygon(fisheries_map, mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = log(aquaculture+1))) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  labs(
    x = "", y = "",
    title = "Fisheries harvest by aquaculture, 2016",
    subtitle = "Aquaculture measured in logged tonnes",
    fill = "log(aquaculture)",
    caption = "Source: bit.ly/2VrawTt"
  )
```

```{r}
fisheries_map <- fisheries_map %>%
  mutate(
    aquaculture_perc = aquaculture / total
  )

ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(world_map, 
               mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), 
               fill = "lightgray") +
  geom_polygon(fisheries_map, 
               mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, 
                             fill = aquaculture_perc)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(labels = percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.key.width = unit(2, "lines")) +
  labs(
    x = "", y = "",
    title = "Average share of aquaculture by country",
    subtitle = "out of total fisheries harvest, 2016",
    caption = "Source: bit.ly/2VrawTt",
    fill = "Aquaculture %"
  )
```
