# Teaching Introductory Statistics and Assessing Learning 

An interactive session providing an overview of the GAISE guidelines, why they exist, how they connect to other pedagogical recommendations, and how they can be applied to different programs (e.g., large and small class sizes and students of diverse backgrounds). We will present some model activities for immediate use in the classroom illustrating the GAISE principles as well as discuss how to assess studentsâ€™ mastery of concepts highlighted in the GAISE principles.
