# Sharing resources and staying connected

During this session we will map out details for how participants will stay connected during the upcoming academic year. This includes identifying avenues for how to contribute content and share their work through existing blogs and webinars and by creating their own platforms .  Several resources for staying connected (CIRTL network, Stat Ed Mentoring Program) will be discussed, and participants will be signed up on a Slack channel that is meant to keep the conversation between the cohort members going beyond the workshop. We will also explain the expectation that during the following year, participants will share and peer-review syllabi, teaching statements, and new/modified activities for use in the classroom and request participants to share assessment items created in the fall and assessment results in the spring. The Spring follow-up conversation will focus on how to use these assessment results to guide next steps of curriculum development.
