# Teaching Introductory Data Science and Assessing Learning 

## Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel

An interactive session providing examples with complex datasets, technology resources, and common pitfalls to watch for. We will provide a repository of resources (lecture notes, assessments, assignments, etc.) to teach an introductory data science course as well as an overview of existing programs and how isolated faculty members can become involved. Open discussion will focus on how the teaching of statistics is likely to involve over the next decade.
