# GAISE recommendations, and teaching-focused career opportunities

## Allan Rossman

In the first half of the session we will provide an overview of the GAISE guidelines, why they exist, how they connect to other pedagogical recommendations, and how they can be applied to different programs (e.g., large and small class sizes and students of diverse backgrounds). We will present some model activities for immediate use in the classroom illustrating the GAISE principles as well as discuss how to assess students’ mastery of concepts highlighted in the GAISE principles.

In the second half, we will provide information on the wide variety of teaching focused career opportunities at teaching oriented institutions, professorships of teaching practice, and postdoc opportunities. The session will also discuss how departmental cultures vary between different disciplines that hire statistics teaching faculty and interdisciplinary opportunities for collaboration across departments as well as how “what’s valued” can vary across various home departments and institutions.
